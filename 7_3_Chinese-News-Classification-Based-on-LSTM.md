# 7.3 Chinese News Classification Based on LSTM


# 1. Code 

# 2. Illustration

## 2.1 Data Preparation

Here we use **cnews** dataset, which is a subset of THUCNews.

Training set: 5000 * 10

Validation set: 500 * 10

Test set: 1000 * 10

## 2.2 Data Loading and Preprocessing

Here we use ```chinese_pre()``` to preprocess the text.

## 2.3 Traing of LSTM

## 2.4 Prediction of LSTM

## 2.5 Visualization

Here we visualize the distribution of word vectors.



We can also visualize some words with high frequency.
